        <h2>What is programming?</h2>
        <h6>2 minutes</h6>
        <p>Programming (also known as coding) is the process of writing instructions to a device, such as a computer or mobile device.

            We write these instructions by using a programming language, which is then interpreted by the device. These sets of instructions may be referred to by various names. A few popular names are program, computer program, application (app), and executable.
        </p>
        <h2>A program</h2>
        <p>A program can be anything that is written with code. A few examples of programs that run on different devices are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Websites</li>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>Phone apps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although it's possible to create a program without writing code, the underlying logic is interpreted to the device and that logic was most likely written with code. A program that runs or executes code is carrying out instructions. The device that you're currently using to read this module is running a program that prints it to your screen.</p>
